This project is the implementation of Class and Inheritance.

Given an 2D grid of N x M point charges, all with the same charge q in the x-y plane, 
centered around the origin, this program computes the magnitude and 
direction of the electric field at a specific point (x, y, z) in space due to all the charges.
